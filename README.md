# Vieginere-Cipher
This python script can code and decode your messages using the vieginere cypher which requires an input and a keyword. I'll modify it to accept input when i have time. Don't worry. It won't be long
Input your message at the second to the last line. The video on how to encrypt and decrypt your messages is on my twitter page @EyetuKingsley. I'll modify it to accept it soon.


1/1/2021: I have fixed a bug that prevents capital letters from being encoded properly and I have added a new feature. You don't need to input your messages and keywords into the code anymore. Just run the scrip and follow the prompts :)
